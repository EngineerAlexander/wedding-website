          <p className="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
            Our journey began on a beautiful spring day in 2018. What started as a chance encounter at a local coffee shop 
            quickly blossomed into something extraordinary. We discovered shared passions for adventure, good food, and 
            making each other laugh until our sides hurt.

          <p className="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
            Our first official date was a disasterâ€”and we wouldn't change a thing! The restaurant lost our reservation, 
            it started pouring rain, and we ended up sharing pizza in the car. But somewhere between the laughter and 
            the pepperoni, we both knew this was the start of something special.

          <p className="text-amber-800 leading-relaxed">
            During a sunset hike to our favorite overlook, the place where we'd shared countless conversations and dreams 
            about the future, the question was finally asked. With the golden light painting the sky and tears of joy in 
            our eyes, we began the next chapter of our adventure together.
